# TON security bug bounty
If you find a critical bug or vulnerability in the TON blockchain (in the C++ code of the main repository) or TON main services (standard wallets, bridge, standard smart contracts), you can send its description and exploitation scenario, and receive a reward.

We are interested in critical vulnerabilities: crash, loss or theft of coins, etc.

You can be eligible for a reward of up to $100,000 in Toncoin for vulnerability, depending on the severity.

Let’s perfect the safety and security of TON together!

Send reports to [@ton_bugs_bot](https://t.me/ton_bugs_bot).

_We reserve the right not to review some reports._
